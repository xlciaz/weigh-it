            Follow these steps to weigh the pros and cons of your decision:
            <ol>
                <li>Enter a positive aspect of your decision as a pro.</li>
                <li>Assign a numerical value (1-10) indicating its importance to you. (1 being it is of little significance, 10 being this factor is greatly important to you)</li>
                <li>Repeat the process for each pro, considering them one at a time. Think carefully!</li>
                <li>Once you're done, click the "Done" button.</li>
                <li>Repeat the same steps for each negative aspect of your decision in the cons section.</li>
                <li>Click "Done" and the program will calculate whether your pros outweigh the cons!</li>
            </ol>
